'''Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its
input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by
5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.
Input: 0100,0011,1010,1001
Output: 1010

New Functions: reversed, ord, filter, lambda
